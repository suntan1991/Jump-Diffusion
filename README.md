# Jump-Diffusion
A simple example to explain the statistical analysis of Li jumps implemented in [1].

Here the main program for analysis is JumpDiffusion.py, which can run as 

python JumpDiffusion.py

To index the crystal sites in Na11M2PS12, I also provide one example in cross_0_z_0.tif file, and all the index in this crystal is stored in Na_grid_site file.

To use this code, please cite our work.
